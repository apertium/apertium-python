* [Code Documentation](documentation.md)

Introduction
------------

- The code-base is in development for the Gsoc '18 project called **Apertium API in Python**.
- The Apertium core modules are written in C++.
- This project is an attempt to make the Apertium modules available in python, which because of it's simplicity is more appealing to users.

About the Existing Code Base
-----------------------------

- The existing code base has the subprocess implementation of the basic functions of Apertium.
- A branch called `windows` has the implementation for the `windows` support and will soon be available on master. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/arghyatiger/c8aab476022158f4bdb3dbe45308cdb4)
