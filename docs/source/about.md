Introduction
------------

- The code-base is in development for the GSoC '19 project called **Apertium API in Python**.
- The Apertium core modules are written in C++.
- This project is an attempt to make the Apertium modules available in python, which because of it's simplicity is more appealing to users.

About the Existing Code Base
-----------------------------

- The existing codebase has `Subprocess` and SWIG wrapper implementations of the basic functions used by Apertium modules.
